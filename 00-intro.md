> ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
>
> * Learner will determine the order to sort element in an array.
> * Learner will explain the difference between element-wise and matrix product of two arrays.
> * Learner will apply reduction functions (mean, min, max) along a given axis.
> * Learner find a specialised numerical algorithm from the ones available in numpy.

> ## Creating a square array {.challenge}
>
> Create a 5x5 square array with number 5 on diagonal and zeros otherwise. Consider using `np.eye` function (you can check the docstring).

> ## Generating random sequences {.challenge}
>
> Generate a random sequence of 10 integers from 1 to 100 without repetition (you may want to use `np.random.rand` and `np.argsort`).

> ## Solving linear equations {.challenge}
>
> Solve the following system of linear equations using numpy. Test the solution.
> $$2x_1 + 3x_2 = 3$$
> $$5x_1 - x_2 = 6$$
