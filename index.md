title: Advanced NumPy
---

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> This lesson covers advanced features of NumPy. If you know how to create a NumPy array and can explain
> how it differs from a Python list, you are ready to go.
>
> If you know how to use array broadcasting and indexing to accelerate your code, the lecture will be
> probably too basic.

> ## Getting ready {.getready}
>
> Make sure that you have a working installation of NumPy.
